Name: Online toll to improve degree planning for BSc students.

Description of project: Improving degree planning for science students, students could select courses by major and form pdf rather than change at the pdf version. For new students, they can choose any pathway they want and find the favourite one.

Jingyuan Kang and Xinchen Lin -- backend
Yuwen Ye and Yutong Zhou --front end
Chole Wang -- database
Yuanchen Mao --design 
Xinchen Lin also --Integration of the code
 
Description of project package and how to startup: 
api -- backend
api -- backend
api -- background

pc -- front end
script -- the environment required for background startup
api/db/cs.sql -- data file required by the system
api/docs/requirements.txt -- the toolkits required in the background startup environment
course.py -- code to process course data
direction.py -- code to handle professional direction data
pc/node_modules -- the environment required for front-end startup (equivalent to the environment required for background startup)

When the program starts, there is no sequence in the front-end and back-end. It depends on your habits, but both must be started before the main page can run. If only the back-end is started, only the back-end system can start normally.

-- How to start the background system
Click on the background start address
Add /admin after the address bar

-- Front-end startup method
Click on the front-end start address

Open api and then click the ‘run manage’ or use ‘shift+f10’ to run the code
Make sure ‘mysql’ is open or it show like this one

If all network environments are configured， it will show like that one and it have the website.

Then when we open the website is shows me page not found dont worry you are right beceuse we just need add ‘\admin’




Hecne management page is open.


Main programming website:
http://localhost:8080          
Remember open management page first
Open the file named ‘pc’ and then click the ‘run manage’ or use ‘shift+f10’ to run the code

Waiting for 30-60 seconds (depend on computer) it will show the website

Then just click it


Note:If the network environment is not configured it will show up like this:
  

Future plan: Move down the path recommendation and students can select courses by years. The courses on the web page are moveable. Further beautify the design of the web page.
